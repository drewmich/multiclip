# A Chrome extension that allows you to have up to 3 additional "clipboards"

This is a Chrome extension I wrote in JavaScript to make it easier to paste multiple things over and over without having to cycle through what is in your clipboard.

This is the popup menu when you click the multiclip icon in the top right of the browser.

This is what the context menu looks like when pasting the items.
